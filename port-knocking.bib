	abstract = {Data theft and espionage attacks, which is evolved rapidly, impose the need to develop new and stealthy communication techniques to protect sensitive data that is transferred over the Internet. These new techniques should be built in different way than traditional and known communication techniques, in order to eschew detection and monitoring tools. This paper proposes a new covert channel for stealthy communication. The communication channel uses Least Significant Bit steganography and Tariq port knocking to hide data, besides that GnuPG encryption is applied before hiding the data to add another layer of protection. The communication efficiency has been evaluated using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, and the result indicates better image quality compared with other techniques. Also, the maximum capacity and transfer rate of the channel have been evaluated, the channel is capable to achieve 152 bps as a maximum transmission rate in its current implementation.},

	abstract = {The latest developments in mobile cloud computing (MCC) have changed user's priorities for computing. However, the change towards MCC brings new challenges to cloud service providers and administrators. Authentication is one among the challenges categorized in the classification of security issues for MCC. Port knocking authentication method eliminates user's collaboration during the authentication process. Thus, such technique has the potential to be applied on the MCC environment which can ensure reliable communication. However, current port knocking authentication techniques lack of addressing the issue of knock-sequence length. It is challenging to deploy appropriate length sequence for port knocking authentication for the reason that shorter length knock-sequence degrades security, whereas, deploying longer length sequence involves performance issues in terms of time and buffer management. This paper proposes a dynamic length port knocking authentication framework which addresses the issue of security degradation and optimizes performance in terms of time up and buffer managment. We employ MikroTik RouterOS for the evaluation of the proposed technique. Analysis of the results shows that dynamic length port knocking authentication technique improves performance in terms of time up to 23\% and buffer management up to 28\% by reducing the imposed load. Furthermore, by deploying dynamic length (DL) and pool of length (PoL), the proposed method reveals high security, which decreases the probability of hacking knock-sequence near to zero for a number of parallel authentication requests. Hence, dynamic length port knocking authentication technique provides an optimal solution for reliable communication in MCC.},

The new technique utilizes three wellknown concepts, these are: port-knocking (PK), steganography, and mutual authentication, therefore, it is referred to as the hybrid port-knocking (HPK) technique.

The performance of the proposed technique was evaluated by measuring the average authentication time, which also compared with the average authentication time for a number of currently used port authentication techniques.},

	abstract = {The most important point in network services is security of access in the port . However, the problem that occurs is an open port or access that cannot be accessed with authentication that can facilitate unauthorized users to be accessed by the server. This is the basis for increasing access rights to the server that is built without having to close the port used by the user. Therefore a port knocking method is needed. Port knocking is a security system that can perform a function that is blocking unwanted access. In principle, port knocking successfully closes all ports on the server. If the user needs access to the server, the user does a "knock" to use the service, then if the user has finished accessing the port is closed again. The system built in this study uses three ports, namely port 22 (SSH), port 23 (Telnet), and port 80 (Web). Port Access time is 10 seconds each. Based on the results of the analysis and testing of the system implementation carried out, the results of the system can be run properly and can improve the security of network systems that are built compared to networks that do not use Port Knocking security. In research assessing on public and local networks. According to the results analysis, carrying out a remote server via local time requires faster time from a remote server through the public. In the SSH protocol there is a difference in time of 2.42 seconds, Telnet 2.14 seconds, and Web 2.19 seconds.},

	abstract = {Port knocking is a technique by which only a single packet or special sequence will permit the ﬁrewall to open a port on a machine where all ports are blocked by default. It is a passive authorization technique which offers ﬁrewall-level authentication to ensure authorized access to potentially vulnerable network services. In this paper, we present performance evaluation and analytical comparison of three widely used port knocking (PK) algorithms, Aldaba, FWKNOP and SIG-2. Comparative analysis is based upon ten selected parameters; Platforms (Supported OS), Implementation (PK, SPA or both), Protocols (UDP, TCP, ICMP), Out of Order packet delivery, NAT (Network Address Translation), Encryption Algorithms, Root privileges (For installation and operation), Weak Passwords, Replay Attacks and IPv6 compatibility. Based upon these parameters, relative performance score has been given to each algorithm. Finally, we deduce that FWKNOP due to compatibility with windows client is the most efﬁcient among chosen PK implementations.},

During this paper presents analyzing the network security concept of Port knock and assess their quality as firewall authentication mechanisms for gap network ports or activity bound actions on servers. This paper is developing and evaluating the performance of a replacement proposed modified hybrid port knock (MHPK) technique with proposed encryption/decryption technique. The planned technique is to stop completely different –different kinds of port attack and fulfill the complete security demand for network. Planned technique is that the combination of 4 ideas, this are port knocks (PK), symmetric key encryption/decryption, steganography and mutual authentication. Primarily it's the improved modification of hybrid port knocking therefore; it's observed because the modified hybrid port-knocking (MHPK) technique.},

	abstract = {The availability of communication resources remote access of e-mails and data is increasingly required and desirable by users. This, however, implies security of user data and e-mails. The vulnerability of the system depends on the ability to scan the system for an open port and on the service running on the open port. Such open ports are entry points for attacks. Masking of open ports and services on the system, using port knocking technique, provides a simple and reliable method. Initially, during the port knock sequence all the ports remains closed, thus the services or open ports become invisible to any malicious port scan. After a valid port knock, a predetermined port is opened allowing access of predefined service. Thus port knocking technique adds an extra layer of security without any major changes to the application.},
